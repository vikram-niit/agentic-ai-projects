# 🤖 Agentic AI Projects

This repository explores the emerging field of **Agentic AI** — systems capable of **reasoning, planning, and acting autonomously** to achieve complex goals.

Projects in this repo demonstrate how to build and orchestrate **AI agents** that can interact with tools, APIs, and each other to complete real-world tasks.
